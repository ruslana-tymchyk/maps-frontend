# 🗺️ GEOS — Geographical Book Search Engine

**GEOS** is an intelligent geographical search engine that lets users ask natural-language queries (e.g. _"fiction books about dogs"_) and discover example books from various genres — displayed both on an interactive map and as a detailed list.

Powered by GPT-4o and enriched with book metadata (title, author, publication year, Goodreads info), GEOS makes literary discovery visual, intuitive, and fun.
